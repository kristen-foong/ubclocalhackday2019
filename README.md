# UBC Local Hack Day 2019

Theme: Diversity, Inclusivity, Accessibility

Problem: Patients being turned away at clinics and hospitals due to race, sexual orientation, etc.

Solution: Admittance through a nurse is eliminated and instead delegated through an application questionnaire, which reads their symptoms and sorts patients by priority. Triage still takes place, but the app gets the person in through the front door.

Team: Maggie Wang, Maggie Liao, Shawn Kek, Kristen Foong
